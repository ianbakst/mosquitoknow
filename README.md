## Predicting mosquito activity in Chicago.
Mosquitoes are more than just annoying. Mosquito-borne illnesses affect many Americans, and the state of Illinois is particularly hard-hit. Last year, the state had over 10% of the countryâ€™s west nile virus cases. To keep these outbreaks at bay, the city of Chicago spends nearly $2M annually on mosquito control including chemical spraying, which is toxic. The question is: Can we make this more efficient? Mosquitoes enjoy standing water and warm air temperatures, and usually reach maturity in 8-10 days.

The solution is to forecast mosquito activity based on weather and geographic features.
The data available includes:
 * Counts of mosquito traps set around the city
 * Geospatial data including the locations of waterways and parks
 * Weather data from one life cycle leading up to a trap observation, including temperatures and precipitation.
